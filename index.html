		<h1>Interesting Places I've Visited</h1>
	<img src="images/TravelTheWorld.jpg">
			<p>
				I haven't traveled much in my life, but the few places I have been to are amazing.
				Two of my favorite places I've experienced are Washington D.C. and Chicago. 
				I can't say which one I enjoyed more, because they are both equally amazing. 
				I hope to one day be able to travel to all of the great cities in this country,
				and even explore the rest of the world! There is so much out there to see. It's practically mind blowing.

			<h2>Washington D.C.</h2>
			<p>
				This was my most recent trip. I attended a music festival in D.C. with my girlfriend,
			my brother and some friends. I had never been to the Nation's Capital before, so I was extra excited
			to start exploring. We did most of our travel on foot, which made for lots of time to really soak in
			all of the scenery and architecture of this great city.

			Since we were there for 4 days, we had a lot
			of time to go sightseeing and make the most out of our stay. My favorite place we visited was the 
			<a href="page2.html">National Mall</a>!
			</p>
			<p>
			Here's a few of the cool places we visited while at the National Mall:
			</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The White House</li>
					<li>The Washington Monument</li>
					<li>The Lincoln Memorial</li> 
					<li>The Smithsonian Museum of Natural History</li>
				</ul>
			<h2>Chicago</h2>
			<p>
				Although I have visited the <a href="page3.html">Windy City</a> multiple times, it still feels like a new experience each time.
				I have been 4 times so far, all for different music festivals during the summer. It is such a fascinating
				and beautiful city. Located right on the edge of Lake Michigan, the endless &amp; very intense breeze is something
				to experience firsthand. My favorite part about the city of Chicago is all of the things you don't normally find
				in a typical "city". The city is filled with rivers, trees and parks all around that give it a very non-city
				feel. Although, the architecture in Chicago is quite impressive. Large scaling buildings align the skyline at
				night. All in all, it's a wonderful place that I feel everyone should have the chance to enjoy at least once in
				their life.
